# Plasma Engine

Plasma is a open source game engine built on top of [Zero Core](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroCore). I started this project as i felt many modern engines where becoming to big for most smaller deverlopers. In addition to this i wanted something smaller for my own personal projects that i had the power to fully customise
